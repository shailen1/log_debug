%%% {shailen.karur, priv/debug_specs/Base.meta}

%%% These specifications can be used with backward compatibility for the most part, since they are considered as 'functional data'

%%% Everything after a '%' is treated as a comment, and every statement is considered at an end by a period '.'.
%%% ".erl" can be dropped from module names 

%%% Drop your specifications for debugging here, like so:
